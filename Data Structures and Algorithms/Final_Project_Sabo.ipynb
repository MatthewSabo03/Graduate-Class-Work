    "### Introduction:\n",
    "With this project, I aim to create a program that will be able to manage various tasks and assignments using a Priority Queue. The program should be able to add an assignment and place it in the right place in the queue, remove the current assignment from the queue, list the current assignment that the user should be working on, and remind the user of when a task or assignment is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures and Algorithms Used:\n",
    "##### Linked List:\n",
    "The reason why a linked list was used in this project is because of the ease of implementation and the time efficiency compared to other options like an array which is less time efficient in removal and peek functions being O(n) compared to a linked list which is O(1). A Binary heap would be more time efficient than a linked list for this implementation, but it is more difficult to implement than using a linked list. So the ease of implementation and the time efficiency compared to other data structures is why I decided to use a linked list.\n",
    "##### Priority Queue:     \n",
    "The reason why I decided to use a Priority Queue compared to other data structures is because it allows for the priority of the assignment to be a factor in where a new node would be placed in the queue rather than a regular queue which would place the new assignment/task on the bottom of the queue regardless of the importance or due date of the assignment/task.\n",

    "This first block of code defines the main data structure that I will use for this assignment, being a Priority Queue. The PriorityQueue class has 5 functions: isEmpty which checks if the linked list is empty, push adds a node to the linked list in the correct position based on the priority of the new node, pop removes the head node from the list and makes the next node the new head node, traverse traverses the linked list and prints out the assignment name and due date, and peek returns the head node. This block also includes a Node class which stores the information of the node and the priority that will be used in calculating where it is placed inside of the linked list"
